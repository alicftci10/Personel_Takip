I developed a Personnel Tracking Application using a .NET Windows Forms application.
The application includes a login process with a limited number of attempts and lists personnel operations based on the authorization type of the logged-in user.

The logged-in user's photo, name, surname, and authorization type are displayed on the screen. 
The application allows users to track operations such as searching, adding, updating, and deleting personnel.
